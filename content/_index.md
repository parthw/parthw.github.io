<b>Hello, I'm Parth Wadhwa, </b>
<br/>
Software Developer and Site Reliability Engineer
<br/>

I work at [Blinkit(formerly grofers)](https://blinkit.com), an e-commerce company based in India. My background is diverse (you could say I'm a specialized generalist), but always close to digital technology.
I have done a bit of everything in backend technology, from backend development to devops or team leading. I love automation as a way to optimize processes and avoid repetitive work, and working in happy agile teams - where work is a way to solve problems, and not a mean by itself.

In this site, I will be sharing my thoughts on various topics related to software engineering, geopolitics and economics. I hope you find my posts informative and enjoyable to read.
